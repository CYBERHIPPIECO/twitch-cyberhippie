Who are you?

My name is Tim or [**mothnode**](http://www.twitter.com/mothnode) and I want to make games, tackle philosophical entropy & look for genuine interactive beauty! From a photographer through filmmaker I became a streamer and aspiring game developer. 

My current aim is to create Cyberhippie Collective, which is:

- a **joyful open indie game studio**
- a **collaborative workspace for game lovers & makers** 
- a **venue for community events** located in Poznań, Poland

If you are interested in the project [read more about it on Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/cyberhippiecollective).

My secondary aim is to create probably the most relaxing stream on Twitch and play the interactive gems of our times. Let's have some fun and see some interactive beauty together!

You can check out the games I stream on the channel roadmap itself. Feel free to suggest new ones if you think there is a great experience to be discovered!

How do I know you're going live?
I always post stream announcements on my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/mothnode). 

You can also [click the Follow button on my Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/cyberhippiecollective) to receive notifications whenever I go live. Feel free to reach out to me and ask questions!

What's the deal with Patreon?

This is a one man operation and all funds received are dedicated to enabling me to work unhindered by the economic nature of things, keeping the stream going and making my game developer workspace project a reality.

Hi all, my name is Cyberhippie (formerly mothnode) and I'm creating a game studio, community workspace and live broadcasts on Twitch. I try to stream 5 times a week with variety of content ranging from IRL streams (longboarding and other things), gamedev, gaming and event coverage. Currently I'm a PC person and usually like to play indie games but I don't stray far from AAA or popular titles. It depends on our community and the mood. Fun fact about me: I drink tea only with honey and milk. Gallons upon gallons of it. Here are my social media profiles and open Discord for the ones who want to dive deeper into our community: www.twitch.tv/cyberhippiecollective https://discord.gg/gbErR3B (Discord) www.facebook.com/cyberhippiecollective www.patreon.com/cyberhippie www.twitter.com/mothnode I'm also doing an 3-month X-Split License Giveaway (first giveaway ever!) so if you need software to stream, have a go: https://gleam.io/lAUic/cyberhippie-gives-away-3month-license-for-xsplit (Cyberhippie gives away 3-Month License for XSplit) Nice to meet you all! <3 SW-1254-3911-5813
